Lessons learned:
- NEON has Q-registers (128-bit) and D-registers (64-bit). Intrinsics using Q-registers has suffix `q` e.g. `vld1q_f32()`. Some instructions has `_lane` in the name, meaning the op will only affect 1 element in each register e.g. `vld4q_lane_f32()` means we will load 4 FP32 into the specified lane across 4 registers.
- NEON's dot product and matrix multiply only support INT8 and BF16. For FP32, we have to use fused multiply-accumulate (FMA) instead, which operates directly on FP32x4 registers.
